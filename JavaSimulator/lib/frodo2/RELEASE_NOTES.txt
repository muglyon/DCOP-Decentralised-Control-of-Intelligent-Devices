CHANGES IN VERSION 2.16 SINCE VERSION 2.15.2

Major changes: 
	- P2-DPOP & MPC-DisWCSP4 now support maximization problems and problems with negative costs/utilities (request by Sankarshan Damle). 
	- Max-Sum now supports synchronous, round-based execution (in addition to asynchronous execution). 
	Preliminary experimental results show that the asynchronous version outperforms the synchronous version on all performance metrics. 
	
Minor changes: 
	- Fixed a NumberFormatException in P-DPOP and P3/2-DPOP (reported by Sankarshan Damle), which now only support AddableBigInteger utilities. 
	- The CATS parser now reports an error when more dummy goods are encountered than announced (issue reported by Sankarshan Damle). 
	- The JaCoPxcspParser now truncates decimal values to integers instead of throwing a NumberFormatException (issue reported by Sankarshan Damle). 
	- Fixed a bug in Max-Sum following which messages were skipped instead of delayed if received before the factor graph message. 
	- Fixed a bug in the factor graph DOT representation: names of function nodes and variable nodes could clash. 
	- Fixed serialization bugs in MPC-Dis[W]CSP4, which did not work with TCP pipes. 
	- Fixed a bug following which P3/2-DPOP would not assign any value to any variable on infeasible problems. 
	- Fixed a bug following which using AddableBigInteger for utilities/costs resulted in 
	algorithms reporting very large instead of infinite utilities/costs on infeasible problems. 
	- Added warnings about truncations when attempting to parse decimal values from XCSP into integers. 
	- Added asserts to check for integer overflows in AddableInteger. 


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.15.2 SINCE VERSION 2.15.1

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.15 SINCE VERSION 2.14

Major changes:

	(support request #10 by Andrea). 
	- The XCSPparser's main function can now split an overall problem into each agent's respective subproblem (support request #10 by Andrea). 
	
Minor changes:

	- Various minor improvements to the Controller and Daemon consoles in the advanced mode. 
	- The name of the agent is now saved in its XCSP subproblem as an attribute "self" of the <agents> tag.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.14 SINCE VERSION 2.13.3

Major changes: 
	- Major performance improvement in the way DPOP's UTIL messages are implemented in JaCoP (performance issue reported by Chirag Vartak). 
	UTIL lookups are now cheaper (constant instead of linear in the number of allowed tuples), resulting in multiple-times speedups.

	used an inconsistent color numbering convention (bug reported by Duc Thien Nguyen). 
	
Minor changes:

	This results in up to 25% median performance improvements on graph coloring problems (19 nodes, density 0.4, 3 colors), 
	and up to 50 % median performance improvements on tight MaxDisCSPs (10 variables, p1 = 0.4, p2 = 0.9).

	- Significant performance improvements to the interface with JaCoP: 
		- 1.5x speedups for AFB and 2x speedups for DPOP on medium-sized graph coloring problems; 
		- 4.5x speedups for AFB and 5x speedups for DPOP on medium-sized, high-tightness, random Max-DisCSPs;

Major changes:

	- Fixed an discrepancy between the computation steps performed before serializing a JaCoP-based solution space

	- The VariableElection module can now be parameterized by a tie-breaking heuristic.

Minor changes:

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.6.1 SINCE VERSION 2.6

Major changes: 
	- Fixed an approximation error in the simulated time metric due to the coarse granularity of System.getCurrentTimeMillis(). Now using System.nanoTime() instead. 
	- Fixed a bug in DSA, which would get stuck in non-existent local minima due to not properly counting the number of conflicts. 
	
Minor changes: 
	- Performance improvements to various algorithms through the introduction of a "delayed addition" functionality.

	- Added a main() method to XCSPparser that just displays the input problem constraint graph in DOT format.
