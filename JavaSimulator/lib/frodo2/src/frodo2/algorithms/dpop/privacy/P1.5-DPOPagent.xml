<!-- Overall definition of the agent
	- measureTime: whether the simulated time metric should be enabled instead of just measuring wall clock time
	- measureMsgs: whether to measure the number of messages and the total amount of information sent (WARNING! This is computationally expensive)

	<!-- The XCSP parser
		- parserClass: the class of the parser/subsolver to be used. Currently supported:
			- frodo2.algorithms.XCSPparser: the default parser that does not consider local subproblems
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.JaCoP.JaCoPxcspParser: a parser based on JaCoP that can be used for DCOPs with complex local subproblems
		- displayGraph: if true, displays the constraint graph in DOT format (default = false)
		- domClass: the class to be used for variable values; the supported values are: 
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.AddableInteger 	(default) for integer-valued variables
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.AddableReal 		for (finite-domain) real-valued variables
		- utilClass: the class to be used for utility values; the supported values are: 
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.AddableInteger 	(default) for integer utilities
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.AddableReal 		for decimal utilities
		- DOTrenderer: the class to be used to display the constraint graph. Supported values:
			- empty string: displays the constraint graph in DOT format in the console; 
			- frodo2.gui.DOTrenderer: renders the constraint graph in a new window. Assumes that Graphviz' "dot" command is on the shell path. 
		- countNCCCs: whether Non-Concurrent Constraint Checks should be counted (default = false)

			- name: the name of the public static String field in the module that identifies the message
			- value: the type to be used for that message
			- ownerClass (optional): if present, specifies the name of a class, and the attribute "value" is then interpreted as a public static String field of that class

					- modulus: must be a safe prime whose number of bits is greater than n * (D - n), 
						where n is the number of variables in the DCOP, and D is the sum of all domain sizes
					- generator: must be such that the powers of the generator cover all the numbers in [1, modulus - 1]
						(Use ElGamalScheme.main() to create the modulus and the generator)
					- infinity: the algorithm will ignore solutions whose cost is >= this value. The complexity (both in memory and runtime)
						is linear in this parameter, so you want to set it to a tight upper bound on the cost of the optimal solution (if any). 
						For pure satisfaction problems, you should choose infinity = 1.
